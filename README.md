# Numerical-Techniques
Codes of my Numerical Techniques module at University - also learning MATLAB


## NOTES :-
> **Warning**
>
> there is difference between % and %% 
> One percent sign ( % ) is used for commenting lines. Two percent signs ( %% ) have a different purpose: they are used for dividing your code into sections, which can be run independently. This allows easier debugging.

> **Note**
>
> `vpa()` is a function to get the answers in decimal form
